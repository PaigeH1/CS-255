# CS-255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-
The central assignment throughout the course revolved around a project called DriverPass, created to handle the widespread problem of inadequate driver preparation. Their findings showed that more than two‑thirds of applicants do not pass the DMV driving exam. To counter this, the DriverPass initiative focused on delivering stronger training options, combining digital learning modules with real-time instruction to help students develop the skills needed to succeed.

What did you do particularly well?
-
This course has significantly strengthened my ability to break down systems and turn complex ideas into clear visual models. Creating diagrams for class structures, activity flows, sequence interactions, and data movement helped me understand each component more deeply, and I’m genuinely proud of the clarity those visuals brought to my work, once I got the hang of using Lucidchart.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-
I’m looking to refine my UML class diagram, especially when it comes to the methods I included. While listing basic getters and setters was straightforward, the way these classes interact calls for deeper consideration. Understanding how each object will actually support user needs shows that additional, more purposeful methods are necessary. Expanding the method set to reflect those relationships would strengthen the design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-
My entire design process began with understanding what users actually needed from the system. Every diagram I built was shaped around the kinds of interactions people were most likely to have. When developing the class diagram, I relied heavily on the insights from the sequence and activity diagrams to predict how each class would function in real scenarios. Without grounding the design in real user expectations, the system risks becoming an abstract model that doesn’t meaningfully address the problems it’s meant to solve.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
-
One of the biggest takeaways from this course was learning to rely on an iterative design process. Instead of trying to perfect every detail at the start a habit that used to slow me down; I now move through a project in multiple rounds. Each pass reveals new insights and allows me to add depth and precision I couldn’t see initially. This approach has proven valuable, and I plan to keep refining it in future work
